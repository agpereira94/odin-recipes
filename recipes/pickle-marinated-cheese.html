    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pickle marinated cheese is a fresh and tangy appetizer, made with layered dill havarti, cream cheese, and cheddar cubes in a sweet, spicy dill pickle marinade.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces havarti cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>6 ounces cream cheese</li>
        <li>2/3 cup finely chopped sweet and spicy dill pickle chips, such as WicklesÂ® Pickles</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped green onions</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ranch seasoning</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pickle brine from pickle jar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cheeses in the freezer for 15 minutes while marinade is prepared</li>
        <li>Combine pickles, green onions, dill, ranch seasoning, red pepper, pickle brine, and apple cider vinegar in medium bowl. Stir in olive oil until well blended and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut each block of cheese in half lengthwise, then cut each piece into 1/4-inch slices, to form square pieces. Cut a small piece off of the cream cheese and place it between alternating flavors of cheese. Place the alternating cheese slices on their sides in the bottom of a small casserole dish. This can be done in 2 to 4 rows depending on the size of the dish.</li>
        <li>Pour the reserved marinade over the cheeses, cover, and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to overnight. Serve with crackers.</li>
    </ol>
