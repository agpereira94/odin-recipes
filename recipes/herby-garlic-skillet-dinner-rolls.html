    <p>These herby garlic skillet dinner rolls are dressed-up frozen dinner roll dough, baked with a buttery garlic and herb coating, and topped with a little grated Parmesan cheese. Your guests will love them!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted, plus more for skillet</li>
        <li>1 generous pinch kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely minced flat-leaf parsley</li> 
        <li>1 tablespoon finely minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>18 frozen dinner roll dough balls, thawed but still firm</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brush a 10-inch cast iron skillet with melted butter. Combine remaining melted butter, salt, garlic, flat-leaf parsley, and rosemary in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Place thawed dough balls into the butter and herb mixture and coat each dough ball thoroughly. Place coated dough balls in the prepared skillet. Reserve any remaining butter-herb mixture.</li>
        <li>Lightly brush a piece of plastic wrap with melted butter, and cover rolls, with buttered side toward rolls. Set in a warm place, without drafts until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Gently remove plastic wrap. Melt remaining herb butter in the microwave, if necessary, and pour over the top of the rolls. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 3 to 5 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
